# Mechanisms and transmissions

Beside the belt machines the simulator has machines built from one motor-driven joint per axis: a ball screw axis, a
rack and pinion axis, a linear motor axis, a rotary indexing table, a six-axis arm and a SCARA arm, both read from URDF
files. Their parts are components in `sim-components`, so that a machine described in a config file can wire them
later; the six machines live in the crate `machine-joint-kit` and are run and sized like every other machine.

The German version of this document is [de/mechanismen.md](de/mechanismen.md).

## The machines

| Id | Mechanism | Transmission | Tool pose | Own checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `screw-axis` | carriage, 800 mm | ball screw 25 x 20 behind a coupling | x (m) | `screw-speed`, `screw-dn`, `screw-buckling`, `screw-static`, `screw-life` |
| `rack-axis` | carriage, 3 m | helical pinion on a rack behind a planetary gearbox of ratio 10, backlash-free | x (m) | `rack-feed-force` |
| `linear-motor-axis` | carriage, 1 m | ironcore linear motor, none | x (m) | `guide-load`, `guide-life` from the attraction |
| `rotary-table` | table of 3 kg m^2 plus the work | strain wave gear of ratio 100 (or worm, or planetary) | c (rad) | `strain-wave-life` |
| `urdf-arm` | six-axis arm, `urdf/six-axis.urdf` | strain wave gears of ratio 120 and 80 | six joint angles (rad) | `strain-wave-life` per joint |
| `scara` | SCARA arm, `urdf/scara.urdf` | strain wave gears; the quill on a ball screw | joints (rad, m, rad) | `strain-wave-life`, the screw's checks on joint 3 |

Every one of them also gets the checks every machine gets: motor peak and RMS torque (`motor-peak`, `motor-thermal`),
drive currents, gearbox peak, cubic-mean torque, input speed and life where `[ratings]` gives them, DC link and braking
resistor, settling. `sim-cli list` names them, and every command takes them:

```text
sim-cli verdicts screw-axis
sim-cli run rack-axis --set rack.service_factor=1.5
sim-cli margins linear-motor-axis
```

Each default config is a sized example: its cycle passes all its verdicts (test
`every_default_cycle_passes_its_verdicts`). Its values are marked `[catalogue]` where they come from a maker's document
(the Siemens 1FK2105-4AF motor and the S210 drive the delta picker uses) and `[estimate]` everywhere else: a screw, rack,
linear motor or strain wave gear of this size as the makers' catalogues list them, not one maker's article. Replace them
with your part's data sheet.

## How they are built

A joint machine (`chain::JointMachine`) is a mechanism plus one `joint::RotaryJoint` per joint. The mechanism gives the
load's dynamics in joint coordinates, M(q) q'' + h(q, q') = tau, and its own signals, rating checks and scene. The joint
gives everything between the motor and the joint: motor friction, ripple and cogging, holding brake, the gearbox
(ratio, torsional stiffness, damping, backlash, efficiency), friction in the joint and its end stops. With
`effects.joint_elasticity` the motors are bodies of their own behind the gearboxes' springs; without, the rigid model,
the rotor turns with the joint times the ratio and each gearbox loses its efficiency on what passes through it.

A joint's coordinate is an angle (rad) or a travel (m). A screw or rack turns the gearbox's output rotation into travel
(`transmission::Converter`): put behind the gearbox, the pair becomes one gearbox in N and m with

- ratio i / lever, the lever the travel per radian (lead / 2 pi, or the pinion's pitch radius);
- stiffness 1 / (lever^2 / k_gearbox + 1 / k_converter): the gearbox's torsional stiffness seen at the joint, in series
  with the screw's or rack's own; damping likewise over lever^2;
- backlash: the gearbox's seen at the joint plus the converter's (with `effects.gearbox_backlash`);
- efficiency: the product (with `effects.gearbox_efficiency`);
- the screw shaft's or pinion's inertia added at the rotor over i^2.

The signal `gearbox.<motor>.output_torque` is the joint force times the lever, over the converter's efficiency while
the motor drives and times it while the load drives back, so the gearbox ratings judge the torque at the gearbox
output, before the screw or pinion. The converter's efficiency is kept apart from the gearbox's
(`RotaryJoint::extra_efficiency`): with `effects.thermal_feedback` the gearbox's temperature changes only its own
share. A sliding joint reads its guides' friction, stroke and stops from
`[slide]` (`RotaryJoint::linear_from_config`).

## Ball screw

`transmission::BallScrew`, config `[screw]`. The formulas are those of ISO 3408-5 and of the screw makers' catalogues:

| Quantity | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| Critical speed | n_cr = 60 / (2 pi) (lambda L)^2 / L^2 sqrt(E I / (rho A)), a uniform steel beam of the root diameter; lambda L = 1.875, pi, 3.927, 4.730 for fixed-free, supported-supported, fixed-supported, fixed-fixed. Allowed: `critical_speed_factor` (0.8) times it. |
| Buckling | F_k = factor pi^2 E I / L^2, factor 1/4, 1, 2.046, 4; allowed F_k / `buckling_safety_factor`. |
| Static load | C0a / `static_safety_factor`. |
| d n | nominal diameter (mm) times speed (r/min), against `max_dn` (0 judges none). |
| Axial stiffness | shaft A E / x (fixed-fixed: A E L / (x (L - x))), nut and fixed bearing in series; taken at the softest nut position. |
| Preload drag | T = K F_pr l / (2 pi), K = 0.05 / sqrt(tan beta) (THK); added to the guides' friction as T 2 pi / l. |
| Life | L10 = (Ca / (fw F_m))^3 10^6 turns. A preloaded nut carries F_pr (1 + F / (2.83 F_pr))^(3/2) until the force lifts the preload (Hiwin). |

The screw's signals: `screw.1.speed` (r/min), `screw.1.dn`, `screw.1.damage_rate` (the share of its life used per hour,
60 |n| (fw F_eq / Ca)^3 / 10^6). The life a check reports is one over the damage rate's mean over the measured pass
(Palmgren-Miner), times the life factor a1 of `ratings.bearing_reliability_percent` (0.25 at 99 %, as for every
bearing life), against `ratings.required_life_h`. The axial force checks take |force|, pulling too, which is on the
safe side for buckling.

A vertical axis: `slide.incline_deg = 90` (gravity pulls along the travel by the sine of the incline).

## Rack and pinion

`transmission::RackPinion`, config `[rack]`: normal module, teeth and helix angle give the pitch radius m z / (2 cos
beta). The check `rack-feed-force` holds the highest force on the teeth (signal `rack.1.feed_force`: the force the load
gets over the rack's efficiency while the pinion drives, times it while the load drives back) against
`rated_feed_force_n` over the application factor K_A (`service_factor`). Rack makers publish the permissible feed force of a pair, not a life formula, so the rack
has no life check; the planetary gearbox before it has its own (`gearbox-life`).

## Linear motor

No transmission: the joint's gearbox has ratio 1 and stands for the forcer's mounting (its stiffness in N/m). The
motor's `[motor]` and `[drive]` values read in N for N m and m for rad: force constant in N/A, the forcer's mass as the
rotor's inertia (not part of `mass.carriage_kg`), speeds in m/s, encoder counts per 2 pi m. The cogging repeats once per pole pitch: `motor.cogging_order`
is replaced by 2 pi / `linear_motor.pole_pitch_m`.

The attraction between forcer and magnet track (`attraction_force_n`) presses on the guides: the signal
`axis.x.guide_load` is the attraction plus the weight of carriage, payload and forcer across the guide, and the guide checks (`guide-load` against
`ratings.guide_max_load_n`, `guide-life` from `ratings.guide_dynamic_load_rating_n`, L10 = (C / P)^3 50 km) judge it.
`guide_friction_coefficient` times the attraction is added to the guides' Coulomb friction.

The scene labels the motor's speed in m/s; it has no shaft to turn.

## Rotary table: strain wave and worm gear

The table turns about a vertical axis: M = table plus work inertia, no gravity torque. `table.gear` selects the gear:

- `"strain-wave"`: `transmission::StrainWave`, Harmonic Drive's catalogue method: L10 = L_n (T_r / T_av)^3 (n_r /
  n_av), T_av the cubic mean output torque weighted with the input speed. Signal `strain_wave.1.damage_rate`, check
  `strain-wave-life`.
- `"worm"`: `transmission::WormGear` gives the efficiency from lead angle gamma, flank friction mu and normal pressure
  angle alpha_n: tan gamma / tan(gamma + rho'), rho' = atan(mu / cos alpha_n). Its back efficiency, tan(gamma - rho') /
  tan gamma, is computed (zero or below: the gear locks itself) but not yet used by the dynamics, see the limits.
  The worm's efficiency is kept apart from the configured gearbox's, as a converter's is.
- `"planetary"`: the `[gearbox]` as it is.

## Arms from URDF files

`rigid::Chain` reads a URDF file (links with their inertials, joints of type revolute, continuous, prismatic and fixed;
fixed joints merge into the body before them; no xacro, no branches) and computes the dynamics by the recursive
Newton-Euler algorithm (Luh, Walker and Paul 1980): the joint torques for given accelerations, the mass matrix column by
column, gravity and velocity terms. The payload is a point mass at `arm.payload_offset_m` from the URDF's tip frame.

Config `[arm]`: `urdf_file` is a path, or `builtin:six-axis` / `builtin:scara` for the examples in
`crates/machine-joint-kit/urdf/`. `gear_ratios` has one entry per joint; each joint's limits are in `[axis.j1]`,
`[axis.j2]`, ... (`max_velocity_rad_s`, or `max_velocity_m_s` for a prismatic joint, and so on). The URDF's limits are the joints' stops; a continuous joint takes `[joint]` `min_angle_deg` and
`max_angle_deg`. A prismatic joint slides on the `[screw]`, coupled to its motor (its ratio must be 1; the
`[gearbox]`'s stiffness and damping stand for the coupling, its efficiency and inertia do not count), with the `[slide]`
friction (the SCARA's quill). A URDF limit left out is 0; an empty range is refused. `ratings.gearbox_reference_speed_rpm`
is refused where the joints' ratios differ, as the gearbox life takes every motor's speed through `gearbox.ratio`. With a
`[strain_wave]` table each revolute joint's gear gets the life check.

The tool pose is the joint positions: cycles are given in joints and the sizing judges motors, gears and screws along
them. The settling tolerance is then in rad (`ratings.settling_tolerance_m` keeps its name); it counts the gears' twist
under the arm's weight, which the motors' encoders do not see (2.6 mrad at joint 2 of the six-axis example reaching
out).

## Telescopic shaft with two cardan joints (delta-d4)

The four-axis delta `delta-d4` (its own crate, built on the D3, not a joint machine) turns its tool through a telescopic
shaft with a cardan joint at each end. One cardan joint bent by beta turns its output unevenly: tan chi = tan phi /
cos beta, the speed between cos beta and 1 / cos beta of the input's, twice a turn. Two joints bent alike in one plane,
the intermediate shaft's yokes in phase (the Z arrangement), cancel: the second gives phi back. On the delta both the
motor's shaft and the tool's are vertical (the platform stays level), so the pair cancels at every pose and the tool
turns with the gearbox's output; only the shaft between turns unevenly. The shaft twists in series with the tool's
gearbox (`effects.shaft_torsion`), its weight share loads the arms (`effects.shaft_mass`) and the telescope's sliding
friction pulls on the platform along the shaft (`effects.telescope_friction`). See the
[model reference](model-reference.md#delta-picker-d4).

## What is checked by hand

Component tests (`sim-components`): the screw's critical speed, buckling load, inertia, stiffness, preload drag, life
and its signals and checks; the converter behind a gearbox (ratio, series stiffness, backlash, efficiency, inertia);
the slide's friction and stops; pitch radius and feed force of the rack; worm efficiencies; strain wave life; the
textbook pendulum and energy conservation of the Newton-Euler chain.

Machine tests (`machine-joint-kit`): every machine passes the standard suite (round trip, static hold, energy
conservation without losses, energy budget with them, step convergence, determinism) and its default cycle passes all
verdicts. On the rigid, loss-free models: the screw reaches 2400 r/min at 0.8 m/s and pushes with the mass times the
acceleration the run reached; the rack's feed force and gearbox torque are m a and m a r; the linear motor's guides carry
2500 + 13 g = 2627.49 N; the table's gear passes J alpha; the six-axis arm reaching out holds 177.304 N m at joint 2
(-1.47753 N m at its motor) and 21.3785 N m at joint 3, summed from the URDF's masses by hand; the SCARA's screw holds
5.5 g = 53.937 N, -0.171686 N m at its motor. A screw 1.6 m long fails `screw-speed`, and a life asked for beyond the
screw's fails `screw-life`. With losses: the rack's gearbox torque and feed force are the load's force over 0.97, the
screw's life shrinks by a1 at 99 % reliability, and the temperature feedback keeps the efficiency of screw, rack and
worm.

## Limits

- The arms are sized in joint space: no Cartesian paths and no inverse kinematics of the tool.
- Every joint of an arm has the same motor, drive and gearbox (only the ratio differs per joint), as the drive reads
  one `[motor]` and `[drive]` per machine; no gearbox life for arms whose joints have different ratios.
- A screw's stiffness is taken at its softest nut position for the whole stroke.
- A worm gear driven back from the load loses as any gearbox does (1 / efficiency) and never locks itself.
- No unbalance on the rotary table, no rack life formula (none published), no cross roller bearing check.
- Not built yet: mechanical cams, electronic cams and flying saw profiles.
